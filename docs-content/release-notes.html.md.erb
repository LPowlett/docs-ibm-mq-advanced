These are release notes for IBM MQ Advanced for Developers for PCF.

##<a id="ver"></a> v3.0.1

**Release Date:** May 24, 2019

Features included in this release:

* Create a single MQ server (Queue Manager) using a StatefulSet with exactly one replica. Kubernetes will ensure that if it fails for some reason, it will be restarted, possibly on a different worker node.
* Create a Service. This is used to ensure that MQ client applications have a consistent IP address to connect to, regardless of where the Queue Manager is actually running.
* Create a Secret. This is used to store passwords used for the default developer configuration.
